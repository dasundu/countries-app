## üîå API Integration
The application integrates with the REST Countries API using the following endpoints:

1. `GET /all` - Retrieves a list of all countries
2. `GET /name/{name}` - Searches for countries by name
3. `GET /region/{region}` - Filters countries by region
4. `GET /alpha/{code}` - Gets detailed information about a specific country using its code

## üöÄ Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SE1020-IT2070-OOP-DSA-25/af-2-dasundu.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=[your-mongodb-connection-string]
   JWT_SECRET=[your-jwt-secret]
   ```
4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`

## üß™ Running Tests
The project includes comprehensive tests for the frontend components and functions.

To run the tests:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

For test coverage report:
```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```



## üîí Authentication Flow
1. User registers with email and password
2. Backend validates the data and creates a new user in the database
3. User logs in with credentials
4. Backend validates credentials and issues a JWT token
5. Frontend stores the token in localStorage for subsequent requests
6. Protected routes verify the token before granting access

## üåü Key Features Implementation

### Country Search and Filtering
The application implements real-time search functionality, allowing users to find countries by name instantly. Additionally, users can filter countries by region and language, with the filters being combinable to narrow down results.

### Favorites System
Authenticated users can add countries to their favorites list. This information is stored in the backend database, allowing users to access their favorites across devices and sessions.

### Responsive Design
Using Tailwind CSS, the application provides a seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The layout adapts intelligently based on screen size.

## üöß Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: API Rate Limiting
**Problem**: The REST Countries API occasionally enforced rate limits during development.

**Solution**: Implemented caching mechanisms to store API responses and reduce the number of requests. Also added error handling to gracefully handle rate limit errors.

### Challenge 2: State Management
**Problem**: Managing global state across components became complex as the application grew.

**Solution**: Utilized React Context API for global state management, particularly for authentication and favorites functionality, simplifying data flow throughout the application.

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization
**Problem**: Initial loading of all countries caused performance issues.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading and pagination to load countries in smaller batches as needed, significantly improving initial load times.

## üîÆ Future Improvements
- Add dark mode toggle
- Implement more detailed country statistics and visualizations
- Add language translation features
- Enhance the favorites system with categories and notes
- Implement offline functionality using service workers
